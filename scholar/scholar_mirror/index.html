<h2>Google Scholar data</h2>

This site contains mirrored search results pages from scholar.google.co.uk for the following authors:

<ul>
<li><a href="s7c6c-u4.html">Nello Cristianini</a></li>
<li><a href="pnkxxyy5.html">Peter Flach</a></li>
<li><a href="el2pjv7x.html">Nigel Smart</a></li>
</ul>

On each of these pages, only the <b>Cited by</b> links have been crawled as well. 
All other links lead to a page warning that you are about to leave the mirror.
<p/>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Only use this mirrored copy of the Google Scholar web pages for
doing your assignment; do not let your Prolog code fetch pages from the Google Scholar site or 
Google will ban you!</p>
